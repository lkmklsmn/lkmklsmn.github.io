#### Research interests
Unlock the power of molecular data science to drive development of novel therapeutics.

We have a track record of applying molecular data science to an diverse portfolio of challenges in molecular biology. In each one of them our focus is collaborative data science.  

##### Develop computational solutions to enhance analysis of single cell RNA sequencing
We developed several deep learning methods spanning a large range of analysis tasks including dimension reduction ([Eraslan/Simon et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6344535/) - [repo](https://github.com/theislab/dca)), batch integration (Simon/Ying et al -[repo](https://github.com/lkmklsmn/insct)), quality control (Yan ... Simon - [repo](https://github.com/lkmklsmn/empty_nn)) and manifold interpretation (Simon et al - [repo](https://github.com/lkmklsmn/DrivAER)). Furthermore, we developed an computational framework for the analysis of mitochondrial variation (Wang ... Simon - [repo](https://github.com/lkmklsmn/MitoTrace)).
